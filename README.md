# PowerPiHAT
A Raspberry Pi HAT for building a whole-house electricity monitor using PZCT-02 split core current transformers.

## Design Decisions
* Use an inexpensive split-core CT capable of 100A, that can be clipped onto the mains in my electrical panel.
* Allow for easy connection of the CTs to the device.
* Produce a spec-compliant HAT.
    * Safely back-power the Raspberry Pi from the HAT.
    * Proper cutouts, clearances, etc.
* Use an inexpensive ADS1115 module to reduce overall part cost. (It's cheaper to buy a breakout module than it is to buy the chips in low quantity)
    * GY-ADS1115 (Available from ebay, aliexpress, etc.)
    * Adafruit ADS1115. Both are pin-compatible, and there are mount holes for each module on the board.

## The Board
You can manufacture the board at home, using dual-sided 2-oz copper-clad board. Important: The traces for the analog input are sized assuming 2oz copper.

I've optimized trace spacing for what I've been capable of producing at home using the 'laser-printer hot-transfer' method to mask prior to chemical etching.
There are also extraneous vias to breakout header pins in case soldering both sides of the pin is problematic (no through-hole plating).

The footprints of the SMT components could be smaller for mass production, but I chose the sizes based on what I've been able to hand-solder with an inexpensive 'hobbiest' 25watt soldering iron with a blade tip.

Contrary to the HAT spec, the mounting holes are not defined as non-plated through-hole in the current repository. Since I'm hand-manufacturing these boards, I need to have a precise drill location. KiCad doesn't seem to emit drill markers to the etch layers unless the hole is plated through-hole. So, I've set those as plated, and will drill the entire pad away.


## Sourcing Parts

Estimated total cost fo the build, with more parts than you need (volume pricing on imports), comes to around **$65** -- including the RaspberryPi!
